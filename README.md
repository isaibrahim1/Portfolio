 ## Design
  - ## Colour Scheme
    

In my CSS file, Iâ€™ve used variables to declare colors, and then applied these throughout the stylesheet. I was introduced to this approach during a hackathonâ€”itâ€™s a useful convention, as it allows for consistent theming and makes global color updates easy by changing the value in a single place.

- I have used `#a855f7` as the **primary color** throughout the site.
- I have used `#9333ea` as the **dark variant of the primary color**, mainly for hover states or stronger accents.
- I have used `#ca8a04` as the **secondary color** for highlights or calls to action.
- I have used `#1f2937` for **main text**, ensuring good readability.
- I have used `#6b7280` for **lighter text**, such as hints or subheadings.
- I have used `#faf5ff` as the **extra light background**, creating soft contrast where needed.


 ## User Experience (UX)
  - First Time Visitor Goals
      - In this portfolio project, I prioritized user-centric design principles, ensuring that the interface is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and accessible to a wide range of users.


- Responsive Design
  - Ensuring the site looks great and functions smoothly across all devices and screen sizes.

- Clear Visual Hierarchy
  - Using design elements like typography, color, and spacing to guide the userâ€™s focus and enhance readability.
